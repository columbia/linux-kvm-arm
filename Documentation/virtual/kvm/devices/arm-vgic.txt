MPIC interrupt controller
=========================

Device types supported:
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC        ARM Generic Interrupt Controller v2.0

Only one VGIC instance may be instantiated through either this API or the
legacy KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP api.  The created VGIC will act as the VM interrupt
controller, requiring emulated user-space devices to inject interrupts to the
VGIC instead of directly to CPUs.

Groups:
  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ADDR
  Attributes:
    KVM_VGIC_V2_ADDR_TYPE_DIST (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GIC distributor
      register mappings.

    KVM_VGIC_V2_ADDR_TYPE_CPU (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GIC virtual cpu
      interface register mappings.

  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_DIST_REGS
  Attributes:
    The attr field of kvm_device_attr encodes two values:
    bits:     | 63   ....  40 | 39 ..  32  |  31   ....    0 |
    values:   |    reserved   |   cpu id   |      offset     |

    The offset is relative to the "Distributor base address" as defined in the
    GICv2 specs.  Getting or setting such a register has the same effect as
    reading or writing the register on the actual hardware from the cpu
    specified with cpu id field.  Note that most distributor fields are not
    banked, but return the same value regardless of the cpu id used to access
    the register.
  Limitations:
    - Priorities are not implemented, and registers are RAZ/WI
  Errors:
    - ENODEV: Getting or setting this register is not yet supported

  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_CPU_REGS
  Attributes:
    The attr field of kvm_device_attr encodes two values:
    bits:     | 63   ....  40 | 39 ..  32  |  31   ....    0 |
    values:   |    reserved   |   cpu id   |      offset     |

    The offsetspecifies the offset from the "CPU interface base address" as
    defined in the GICv2 specs.  Getting or setting such a register has the
    same effect as reading or writing the register on the actual hardware.
  Limitations:
    - Priorities are not implemented, and registers are RAZ/WI
